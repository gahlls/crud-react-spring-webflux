# crud-react-spring-webflux

A simple CRUD application with React and Spring Boot Webflux.

# Installation
Is necessary install java 8, Mongodb and NodeJs. I used Mongodb v3.0.15 and NodeJs v8.10.0 <br />

The project backend is created with Maven, so you just need to import it to your IDE and build the project to resolve the dependencies.

# Usage
First run the project backend and after run front application with <b>$ npm start</b>
